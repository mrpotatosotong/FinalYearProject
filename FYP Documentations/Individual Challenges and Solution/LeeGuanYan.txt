What I do:
geopy(location)
addPolyline(data: table, latitude = c(starting latitude,ending latitude), longitude = c(starting longtitude, ending longitude), color = "color", weight = "0")

What are the challenges I face and I overcome it:
  The Geopy method need additional module in python to run. Researched and downloaded a file is suppose to run and download geopy, but it did not work.
Teng Long step in and help me install the module as he was downloading another module for mysql in python. After that I tried, the geopy was working.

  Another challenge I was faced was addPolyline(). I did not know how to add line to the map, so I went to google to find add line for Rstudio. But, the 
search engine returns adding line for rstudio for graph, not for visual maps. Had a hard time searching for simple example, until I came across add
shapes for Rstudio. The problem was the shape are not flexible enought to change into an arrow, therefore I gave up on the idea and searched other
ways. Then I change my search to "how to connect multiple coordinate", it returns 2 different way, spartial lines and add polylines. Spartial was too 
hard to understand, therefore, I focus on add polyline. But add polyline had a problem, it will connect all the coordinate that is given to the method.

  So I had to searched how to seperate the lines. There were two ways, using for loop and using grouping from the method. The for loop gave me error and
we were running short of time. I went to tried grouping after that while Teng Long decided to help me and manage to get the for loop running.
